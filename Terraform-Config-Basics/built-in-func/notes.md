### Built-In Functions
- Terraform provides some built in functions to perform some transformations and combinations.

- In our case, we have used `upper` and `format` built in functions to change the case of the variables to UPPER CASE and format the strings with the variables.

- There are many other prebuilt functions, check out - [built-in-function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions.html)
