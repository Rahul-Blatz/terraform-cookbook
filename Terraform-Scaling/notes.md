## Terraform Scaling

- Advantage of Iac is that, we can create large scale of infra quicker and hassle free than manually provisioning.

- We are going to follow a common principle - DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself). Meaning not to duplicate code.

- We are going to make use of expressions such as count, maps, collections and array.

- This will help in not create duplicate codes and write simple codes for high scaling like for many environments with many resources.
