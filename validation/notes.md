### Validation 
- you can have a condition to make sure that only values that are of certain kind or certain options only.

-> you create a `validation` property and inside that you create a `condition` whether the location can be of either `asia` or `asia-south-east`

-> Any other value than that will throw an error that you have stated in `error_message`
